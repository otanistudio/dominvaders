DOM Invaders!

When done, it'll be at http://otanistudio.github.com/dominvaders/

Self-Imposed Challenge
----------------------
Using JavaScript, approximate a Space Invaders "clone" while riding the morning train from San Jose to San Francisco for GDC. 

*Given the environment and time pressure it's even odds that I'll fail.*

Caltrain's northbound morning "bullet" on Friday, March 9, 2012 runs just under an hour. I hope to find a decent seat with enough room for my legs and a laptop on the 8:03 &rarr; 9:02 bullet. Hopefully, my iPhone tethering will work well enough for me to periodically push updates to this repo as I travel north so that my progress can be tracked "live."

*Mise en place*
---------------
Things I'll have setup the night before my train ride: Some empty markup, bitmaps and at least one library.

Why?
----
This is mainly a personal challenge where I take a self-defined coding exercise and try to make it work in a short amount of time with the additional stress that Caltrain has to offer: Packed trains, intermittent wireless connections, mechanical noise, shaky cars, ticket checkers, announcements over the P.A. system, loud cellphone talkers, and... passenger body odor. I'll also announce when I start via a Tweet so that my followers may belittle me.

Things I already knew before starting: I wrote a really crappy version a long long time ago using YUI and then threw-away the code except for the .gif files, which I'll be re-using.

Also, the DOM sucks at this.
